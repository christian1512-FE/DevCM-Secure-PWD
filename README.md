MODULE 3 CHALLENGE RANDOM PASSWORD GENERATOR.

## Description
The purpose of this challenge is to create a random password generator. The user is able to select different types of password criteria such as the length of the password anywhere from 8 characters up to 128 characters, adding uppercase, lowercase letters, and special charecter. One of the biggest benefits of this application is that the user is able to create strong passwords for greater security.
